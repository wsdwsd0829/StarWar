features:
1. cache json file, and sd webimage cache (only for saving time)
2. ipad, iphone fixed size, according to design. ( I can make it dynamic by making self-sizing cell or custom collection layout.)
3. share (use default only)
4. rolation. 
5. stretchy header. 
6. transition animation, key frame animation. 


declare: 
1. Save image with SD web image, not best solution. see TODO
2. file names better use prefix company letters like "PUN"
3. back button not use image as design, need designer help :)


TODO if have more time: 
1.smooth animation,  
2. core data. for caching, load faster instead of saving json file directly. 
3. for image save to disk use uuid and save name to core data or plist map event id to uuid
4. refactor animation & strechy header to make reusable
